 Microsoft Metaverse</p>
<p>From Naples comes the signal of a hybrid education out of time and place. But also more accessible and inclusive, even from the most distant countries (and students), now by definition without resources and infrastructure. <strong>For the first time in Italy, a university is systematically applying participated and laboratory teaching in mixed reality within its own degree courses.</strong> The Federico II is the first university to start experimenting with Hybrid Learning Spaces, a solution developed by Hevolus Innovation and Microsoft Italia.</p>
<p>The acceleration that the pandemic has imprinted on digitalization processes, and on distance learning in particular, has brought to the forefront the boundless possibilities that more digital knowledge management can produce, both in terms of access to <strong>innovative content, unprecedented learning experiences, and the acquisition of new skills.</strong> Here is an example of what we can definitely call <strong>hybrid teaching.</strong> An academic approach where physical and digital integrate and coexist in an unconventional way, giving rise to innovative paths with greater content potential. But above all experiential immersions that can prove decisive in learning processes.</p>
<p>In this scenario is synthesized the Hybrid Learning Spaces model, based on real immersive virtual classrooms that allow to introduce a new educational model usable both remotely and in presence, through lectures and <strong>holographic lab support.</strong> The University of Naples is the first in our country, and probably among the first at the international level, to test the solution in the educational fields, both scientific and humanistic. It is easy to understand the revolutionary potential of this experience that in its easy scalability opens the door to a real academic revolution.</p>
<p>There is a word that oversees and becomes the context of this vision: <strong>metaverse</strong>. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced it during Ignite 2021 - Microsoft&rsquo;s main conference dedicated to the Enterprise world. In that occasion he stated that cloud-based solutions should be made available to public and private realities to realize the metaverse, with the aim of <strong>enabling shared experiences between the physical and digital world.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Federico II University wants to make innovative technologies available to its students for teaching,&rdquo; says Giovanni B. Barone, systems division manager at the University of Naples Federico II. &ldquo;After managing the emergency period with distance learning, the University is now ready to rethink a new hybrid didactics: this is why it immediately took the opportunity to test and evaluate Hybrid Learning Spaces for some courses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brave choice, that of distance learning, still the subject of debate and controversy, made possible by the high technological performance of the partners. &ldquo;New technologies, smart devices and the hybrid approach allow educational institutions to respond to the ongoing paradigm shift with an interactive and multidisciplinary experiential model able to put the student at the center, involving him personally and stimulating his spirit of initiative&rdquo;, explains Antonio Squeo, CEO of Hevolus Innovation, a digital company specialized in <strong>phygital customer</strong> experience and participated by Fondo Italia Venture II, by Fondo Imprese Sud, managed by Cdp Venture Capital Sgr. &ldquo;We are convinced that this project, developed together with Microsoft, can help the education and training sector to approach young people in a new way, also by providing specific skills on team collaboration techniques that are fundamental in the world of work&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s global outlook helps. Especially when focusing on the central theme: the ability to manage knowledge on the part of young people, who are entrusted with the task of designing the future with increasingly innovative and quicker paths to manage. &ldquo;We are in a crucial phase for our country,&rdquo; commented Elvira Carzaniga, director of the Education Division of Microsoft Italy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A historical moment of great changes and opportunities where we are returning to focus on young people, the true engine of the future growth of our country, investing in their training and development of new skills. In this scenario, digital has a key role as an enabler of new hybrid experiences of teaching and new technologies can help to press the accelerator on this transformation already underway.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The topic of the metaverse has become hot in recent weeks but it is something that <strong>has been around for a long time</strong>. Tobias Van Schneider already described it in 2016.
The problems of such a new world were already clear then. Mattia Ferraresi denounced them shortly after Tobias' article came out.
Both of these articles are linked in the brand new &ldquo;Press&rdquo; section where all the articles I find interesting are collected. I&rsquo;ll try to divide them by theme or something like that, I hope it can be useful to have a kind of press review.</p>
<p>It is possible to define man as a <strong>desiring animal</strong>, as long as he is alive he desires. As Schopenauer affirmed, the will is something that prescinds the intellect, something innate. How can we not be fascinated by the comfort, the brilliance of virtual reality? The pixels shine and make our eyes sparkle.
In this non-real reality everything is new, we experience perspectives never seen before. Everything new is beautiful. And here we are in a vicious circle, every time we find something new, it is no longer new and we find ourselves with nothing in our hands.</p>
<p>The comfort of this virtual world is scary, why should we ever go back to physical reality? Why should we live in a reality where we struggle, where we waste time moving from one place to another? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be much easier to use teleportation? <strong>Why should we live in the old and dull virtual reality?</strong></p>
