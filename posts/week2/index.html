			<p>I saw that you enjoyed last week&rsquo;s post! A lot of people read it and that makes me happy.
I have to say that this week has been a very special week so far. I am starting to write on Thursday, February 24, 2022, probably a date that will be written in the history books. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen in the next few days. I definitely have my college entrance exam tomorrow and I hope it goes well.
Everything that is happening in the world is not normal. A pandemic, now a war and then who knows. All this weighs down the days. Even we have lived a pseudo-normality until now, I have never felt as light as I did before the pandemic. I carry heaviness in me. I can&rsquo;t figure out what it&rsquo;s due to. It makes me feel the weight of things totally on my shoulders and therefore makes me feel even heavier. I feel like the things I have to do in everyday life are completely on me. Slowly it is becoming a &ldquo;what a struggle to do this&rdquo;, &ldquo;what a struggle to do this other&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s kind of lost the magic and beauty that doing things used to have. It probably has it now too but I&rsquo;m just struggling to see it. It will show! I am confident after all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying like crazy this week but still got to save a few items to my [Pocket](<a href="https://getpocket.com/">https://getpocket.com/</a>) list. I recommend it, it&rsquo;s a place where you can save articles you like and not have them disappear in the whirlwind of information that storms our cell phone or pc.</p>
<h2 id="articles-of-the-week">Articles of the Week</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dday.it/redazione/41936/controllare-la-fusione-nucleare-con-lintelligenza-artificiale-deepmind-dimostra-che-si-puo-fare?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Controlling nuclear fusion with Artificial Intelligence: DeepMind proves it can be done</a>. You may have already heard DeepMind. (If you haven&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s only because you didn&rsquo;t read last week&rsquo;s article). A really interesting article but in this historical moment is scary, it seems a dejavu of Oppenheimer and his atomic bomb. In short, not very reassuring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rainews.it/articoli/2022/02/stati-uniti-per-la-prima-volta-registrato-un-cervello-morente-758f9dd0-a3f7-41c1-a7dd-c5303402cd4c.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist">US study, the dying brain relives some of our best memories</a>. I think this is the first RaiNews article I have ever read. The article doesn&rsquo;t say much more than the title but it made me smile to think about the fact that such a thing can happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/first-dying-brain-recording-shows-26306783">First dying brain recording shows people &lsquo;replay&rsquo; best memories in final moments</a>. If you want to read something slightly more specific about the article above, here you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://futureofstorytelling.org/story/anil-seth-ep-56">Anil Seth, Fost Podcast</a>. And to conclude a podcast! Not very long, 32 minutes. If you have a few car commutes I recommend listening to it!</p>
<h2 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the Week</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There is also a form of fatigue that brings well-being and happiness.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We should rediscover the ability to do nothing, to linger, the virtues of inaction.&rdquo;
Byung-Chul Han, in an interview by Leonardo Caffo on &ldquo;7&rdquo;.</p>
