We all have shabby musical instruments, dusty sports equipment, a few barely scratched language texts, the too-long pants that have lived in your closet for half a decade and will teach you how to hem someday&hellip;

<p>The <strong>desire to learn something new</strong> arises from that best and most curious part of us. But then we have to get down to business. When it&rsquo;s day three on the keyboard and the cat who walks the keys still sounds better than we do, we can get discouraged - and often give up.</p>
<p>Writer <strong>Josh Kaufman</strong>, author of <em>The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything &hellip; Fast and The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business</em>, has figured out why so many of us get stopped in our tracks during this first period of learning. &ldquo;Feeling stupid is not good, and the beginning of learning anything new is feeling stupid,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Through trial and error, she found four steps that can help you climb the steep slope of the learning curve in less than 20 hours. Why 20? As he says, &ldquo;20 hours is doable - that&rsquo;s about 45 minutes a day for about a month, even skipping a couple of days here and there.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="break-down-a-skill-into-its-components">Break down a skill into its components.</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is <strong>decide what you want to learn</strong>, and then break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Let&rsquo;s say you want to bake your own bread. This is a multi-step process that includes preparing the dough, rising, punching, forming a loaf, and baking. You&rsquo;ll start by identifying the different tools and skills behind each step.</p>
<p>Or, if you choose yoga as your new hobby, start at home with a video that shows you the basic poses and breathing techniques - and then go try a class.</p>
<h2 id="learn-enough-to-know-when-youre-making-a-mistake">Learn enough to know when you&rsquo;re making a mistake.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Get three to five resources on what you&rsquo;re trying to learn,&rdquo; Kaufman says. &ldquo;They could be books, they could be DVDs, they could be anything, but don&rsquo;t use them as a way to procrastinate.&rdquo; After all, you won&rsquo;t learn how to bake bread or do yoga if you don&rsquo;t get out the flour or yoga mat and do something.</p>
<p>Set a limit on the number of resources you&rsquo;re consulting - you don&rsquo;t need to buy every book or watch every YouTube video on the topic; there&rsquo;s time for that later - and jump in.</p>
<h2 id="remove-all-barriers-to-practice">Remove all barriers to practice.</h2>
<p>This may require putting away your electronic devices while you tackle your hobby. Or get creative and combine your favorite distraction with your new activity. In a TEDxPenn talk, behavioral scientist Katherine Milkman advocates a technique called &ldquo;temptation bundling&rdquo;: pairing something you know you love to do with something you&rsquo;re trying to get yourself to do. Turn on your favorite podcast while you cook, or you could turn your weekly coffee with a friend into a weekly at-home yoga session with the two of you.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-for-at-least-20-hours">Exercise for at least 20 hours.</h2>
<p>To overcome what Kaufman calls the <strong>&ldquo;frustration barrier&rdquo;</strong> - that period in the beginning when you&rsquo;re painfully incompetent and you know it - you need to commit to continuing your new activity for at least 20 hours. At that point, he says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be amazed at how good you are.&rdquo;</p>
