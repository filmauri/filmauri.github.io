<p>In the 90′s, neuroscientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_A._Goodale"><strong>Melvyn Goodale</strong></a> began studying people with a condition called visual form agnosia. These individuals can&rsquo;t consciously see the shape or orientation of objects, but they act as if they can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you hold a pencil in front of them and ask them if it&rsquo;s horizontal or vertical, they can&rsquo;t tell, but, amazingly, they can reach out and grab that pencil, correctly orienting their hand as they reach to make contact with it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goodale&rsquo;s initial interest was in <strong>how the brain processes vision</strong>. But as his work to document the two visual systems that govern conscious and unconscious vision progressed, he caught the attention of <strong>philosophers</strong>, who drew him into conversations about consciousness - a merging of fields that transformed both.</p>
<p>Recently developed techniques for measuring brain activity are allowing scientists to refine their theories about what consciousness is, how it forms in the brain, and <strong>where the boundaries between being conscious and unconscious lie</strong>. And as our understanding of consciousness improves, some researchers are beginning to build strategies for manipulating it, with the potential to treat brain injuries, phobias and mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still fundamentally mysterious how consciousness happens,&rdquo; says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Seth"><strong>Anil Seth</strong></a>, a cognitive and computational neuroscientist and co-director of the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK.</p>
<h2 id="a-weird-discovery">A weird discovery</h2>
<p>Consciousness is often described as the subjective experience of the mind. While a basic robot may unconsciously detect conditions such as color, temperature or sound, consciousness describes the qualitative sensation that is associated with those perceptions, along with the deeper processes of reflection, communication and thought, says <a href="https://matthias-michel.wixsite.com/michel"><strong>Matthias Michel</strong></a>, a philosopher of science and doctoral candidate at Sorbonne University in Paris.</p>
<p>Research slumbered for much of the 20th century, when psychologists <strong>rejected introspection to focus instead on observable behaviors and the stimuli that caused them.</strong> Even into the 1970s and 1980s, consciousness remained a controversial topic among scientists. Early in his career, molecular biologist and Nobel laureate Francis Crick wanted to study consciousness, but chose instead to work on the more tangible mysteries of DNA.</p>

<p>A series of discoveries followed, including the case of a 23-year-old woman who suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident in July 2005 that left her in an unresponsive state, also known as <strong>unconscious waking</strong>. She could open her eyes and displayed sleep and wake cycles, but she did not respond to commands or show signs of voluntary movement. He was still unresponsive five months later. In a unique study, Adrian Owen, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, observed the woman with fMRI while giving her a series of verbal commands. <strong>When they asked her to imagine walking through her home, activity instead ramped up in three areas of the brain that are associated with movement and memory.</strong> The researchers observed the same patterns in healthy volunteers who received identical instructions.</p>
<p>The scientists also began testing <strong>ways to detect consciousness without the need to give people verbal instructions.</strong> In a series of studies that began in 2013, neuroscientist Marcello Massimini of the University of Milan and his colleagues used a technique that is similar to <strong>knocking on the brain,</strong> in the same way a person might knock on a wall to measure its thickness.</p>
<p>While a person is under general anesthesia, or in a dreamless sleep, the echoes produced are simple. But in the conscious brain, the echoes are complex and spread widely over the surface of the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain). <strong>The work could eventually lead to a tool that can detect consciousness even in people who can&rsquo;t see, hear or respond to verbal commands.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a general assimilation of consciousness within the standard practice of neuroscience and psychology and medicine. It&rsquo;s become more normalized, which is a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
