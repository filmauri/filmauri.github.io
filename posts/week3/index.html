			<p>This week I couldn&rsquo;t find a moment to devote to writing this post. I&rsquo;m writing it just before sharing it with you.
It has not been an easy week. Several times I found myself bombarded with news of war. Even though I didn&rsquo;t want to, the news would come at me at any time and it didn&rsquo;t make me live my life since it occupied my thoughts so much. When I started to hear this I tried to inform myself in well defined moments so that I could live. Few times more than now we are asked not to cower in the sadness or fear that are certainly there.
There is a need to stay true in front of what is happening to take sides. A prof of mine, who is more than a prof is a mentor, sent me to read an article by Sol≈æenicyn that talks about this very thing. <a href="https://www.lessiconaturale.it/vivere-senza-vergogna/">Here it is.</a>
I recommend that you spend a few minutes reading this, it sticks with you and you keep realizing how many times we lie or say things that are only half true.</p>
<p>Another episode that turned my week around was writing an essay on the battle for equality for African Americans. During class lectures, the topic had not excited me. Writing it, however, was a way to take a fresh look at this history that has lasted more than 500 years, from the discovery of America to the present day.  It is absurd how a community can achieve their goal, almost exclusively in a peaceful way. Even the most closed-minded people could not help but understand the truth of the demands made by African Americans.
This story has much to teach us.</p>
<p>Who knows what the future has in store for us.</p>
<p>There were not many interesting things I discovered this week but I recommend this article and a book I am reading.
<a href="https://www.futuroprossimo.it/2022/03/nel-cervello-umano-ce-un-universo-multidimensionale/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">In the human brain there is a multidimensional universe</a> I recommend you to watch the video of the article, super interesting
<a href="https://www.amazon.it/Rumore-difetto-del-ragionamento-umano/dp/8851185549">Noise: A Flaw in Human Reasoning</a>, by Daniel Kahneman that makes us discover that we cannot make unambiguous decisions dictated by objective criteria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of us therefore, overcoming pusillanimity, make his own choice: either remain a conscious servant of lies (certainly not out of inclination, but to feed the family, to educate the children in the spirit of lies!), or convince himself that the time has come to shake himself, to become an honest person, worthy of the respect of both his children and his contemporaries.&rdquo;
