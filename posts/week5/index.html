			<p>This is the second article of the week!
If you&rsquo;d like to read the other one as well <strong>sign up for the newsletter</strong>, it&rsquo;ll be coming **Wednesday!
I was thinking that we are really living in a particular moment. Not an extremely revolutionary thought though in short.
The article that comes out on Wednesday will talk about how the invisible nfluence of the things we see every day shape our thinking about things, in this case what happens in the world. I had already written an article on <a href="https://filmauri.github.io/posts/post04/">&ldquo;Invisible Influence by Jonah Berger&rdquo;</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to read more take a look at it!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re here to talk about though.
What&rsquo;s going on around me, which everyone is incessantly focused on, makes me want to be useful. I would like to make a contribution to the world. Unfortunately, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; is not the easiest thing to figure out.
I feel a strong tension towards the world, towards all that is outside of me. Over the past couple of years, we have been driven to work on ourselves. I&rsquo;ve always felt compelled to better myself, to become the best version of me.
Now I feel like I want to raise my head to the Other, to what is outside of me. The pluricited Byung-Chul Han in his <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Lespulsione-dellaltro-Byung-Chul-Han/dp/8874526652/ref=sr_1_1?crid=IYCL6VNKKTDN&amp;keywords=l+expulsion+of+the+other+byung+chul+han&amp;qid=1647723902&amp;sprefix=the%27expulsion%2Caps%2C147&amp;sr=8-1">&ldquo;The Expulsion of the Other&rdquo;</a> describes this movement of alienation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The noisy society of fatigue is deaf. The society to come might instead be called a society of listening and attention. What is needed today is a revolution of time that will initiate a completely different kind of time. It is about discovering the new time of the Other</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole movement towards the Other has been blocked by many, perhaps too many, things. We live in a society that tends to standardize into groups, that creates categories. Everyone creates their own bubble, no one wants to get out of their comfort zone, it&rsquo;s warm and comfortable.
Instead, we need to be available to what the Other is. Only in this way can one be part of the real world and not of an idea that everyone has of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>As usual here are the articles of the week!
<p><a href="https://www.lanuovaeuropa.org/guerra/2022/03/16/la-guerra-e-il-nostro-vuoto/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">War and our emptiness</a>, an article by Rocco Buttiglione. It brings us back to what we need.</p>
<p><a href="https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">The man who created cryptocurrencies is worried about their future</a>, an article from Time. Perhaps one of the longest of my life but absolutely worth it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hdblog.it/scienza/articoli/n552506/ai-robotica-enzima-midollo-spinale-cura/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">AI and robotics together in the fight against spinal cord injury</a>, HDBlog article. Much shorter than Time&rsquo;s but no less interesting!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doppiozero.com/materiali/diario-russo-19-marzo-2022">Russian Diary. March 19, 2022</a>, an article by <a href="https://www.doppiozero.com/">DoubleZero</a>. A must read!</p>
<p>Peace out!</p>
