<p>In a paper published online, Google researchers in collaboration with physicists from Stanford, Princeton and other universities claim to have used Google&rsquo;s proprietary quantum computer to create a real time crystal.</p>
<p>In what could prove to be an incredible achievement for quantum physics, what exactly is a time crystal? A (three-dimensional) crystal is physically speaking is something that repeats itself periodically in space, so the reason for the name &ldquo;temporal crystal&rdquo; is easily imaginable.

<h2 id="what-is-the-temporal-crystal-that-google-has-created">What is the temporal crystal that Google has created?</h2>
<p>A temporal crystal is therefore a <strong>structure that repeats itself periodically in time</strong>, as well as a normal three-dimensional crystal that repeats itself periodically in space. It is therefore a system that constantly changes over time but always returns to its initial configuration at the end of a period. The idea originated in its first proposal in 2012 by physicist Frank Wilczek, while the first observations of temporal crystals were published in 2017.</p>
<p>It is therefore a new phase of matter that physicists have been trying to achieve for many years, a temporal crystal is therefore an object whose parts move in a regular and repetitive cycle, sustaining this constant change without burning any energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The consequence is surprising: <strong>it circumvents the second law of thermodynamics</strong>, the law that says that disorder always increases.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-was-the-time-crystal-made">How was the time crystal made?</h2>
<p>For the realization of the time crystal, three main steps were followed. First, a row of particles is created, each with its own magnetic orientation and a mix of low and high energy. This is what is known as many-body localization.</p>
<p>This creates a stable system. By flipping them all over we get a mirror particle orientation, but still stable. This is known as <strong>&ldquo;eigenstate ordering&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, there is the application of laser light. This causes the states <em>to move continuously from normal to mirrored</em>, in a <strong>periodic motion</strong>, but without actually using the energy of the laser itself. The result is known as the Floquet time crystal, first proposed in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Google&rsquo;s quantum computer</strong>, known as Sycamore, was used to create it, using 20 of its qubits. Each qubit can maintain two states simultaneously. By adjusting the strength of interaction between the individual qubits, the researchers were able to achieve the inversion of the states. The microwaves then flipped the particles into their mirror orientation, but without the spin change taking net energy from that laser itself.

<h2 id="possible-applications">Possible applications</h2>
<p>In the future, one can exploit these temporal crystals for several applications. One possible application for temporal crystals is in high-precision sensors. Currently, for example, impurities in diamonds are used to measure minute changes in temperature and magnetic field.</p>
<p>However, this approach has physical limitations, as too many impurities would destroy the delicate measurement system. In a temporal crystal, on the other hand, the interactions serve to increase the stability of the system and it is therefore possible to obtain a signal strong enough to be able to efficiently probe living cells and atom-dense materials.</p>
