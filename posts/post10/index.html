It was back in the year 2000 when <strong>Mel Gibson</strong>, in the movie <strong>What Women Want</strong>, due to a small accident had managed to find out what women really thought. <strong>Pure fantasy</strong>, of course, but in 2021 we can finally say that understanding the human brain is possible and all thanks to the use of artificial intelligence in the field of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Researchers at <strong>MIT</strong> are working on segmenting the anatomical structures of the human brain, automating the process thanks to AI, while IBM has created a cloud-based neuroscience model for studying neurodegenerative disorders, using algorithms that mimic biological evolution to find solutions to factually complex problems.</p>
<p>But research involving the use of artificial intelligence in neuroscience is well underway. It can be said that, to date, there are already proven systems for treating symptoms of depression, machine learning software capable of recognizing brain changes caused by advancing <strong>Alzheimer</strong>, and scans capable of identifying suicidal tendencies.</p>

<h2 id="a-breakthrough-at-the-university-of-bari-new-early-diagnosis-software-for-alzheimers-disease">A breakthrough at the University of Bari: new early diagnosis software for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</h2>
<p>At the University of Bari, the team led by physicist Marianna La Rocca has developed a special machine learning algorithm capable of discerning structural changes in the brain caused by the advancement of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>The algorithm was &ldquo;trained&rdquo; through 67 images obtained from the MRI instrument to learn to <strong>recognize a healthy brain from a sick one.</strong> The researchers divided each image into small regions, analyzed the neuronal connectivity and found that the software, under certain conditions, is able to make a very accurate classification of the stage of the disease.</p>
<p>By analyzing a series of brain scans, the system was able to distinguish the disease with <strong>86% accuracy</strong>. For La Rocca, this shows that the algorithm he developed is perfectly capable of identifying changes in the brain that lead to Alzheimer <strong>with almost a decade&rsquo;s notice of the onset of clinical symptoms.</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there are already brain scans that are able to predict, with relative accuracy, whether or not there is a risk of developing Alzheimer in an individual within ten years. The problem is that these are invasive and expensive methods, available only in highly specialized centers. The new software developed by the University of Bari, however, provides for <strong>simpler and less invasive techniques, as well as cheaper</strong>. That&rsquo;s why they are now thinking of applying this new discovery of early diagnosis also to other neurodegenerative diseases such as, for example, Parkinson disease.</p>
<h2 id="an-algorithm-to-identify-potential-suicides">An algorithm to identify potential suicides</h2>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence in the field of neuroscience is also reflected in the <strong>identification of suicides.</strong> A group of psychologists and psychiatrists from several American universities have developed a similar algorithm to identify potential suicides.</p>
<p>To do so, they subjected 34 young people to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), presenting them with three lists consisting of ten words: one related to suicide (e.g., death, distress, fatal), one positive (e.g., good, innocence) and another negative (e.g., boredom, evil). The researchers used previously mapped brain images showing particular emotional patterns and identified five locations in the brain as the best markers for distinguishing suicidal individuals from others.</p>
<p>After this initial piece of research, they then trained a machine learning classifier that could <strong>correctly identify 15 of the 17 suicidal patients analyzed.</strong>

<h2 id="ibms-new-discoveries">IBM&rsquo;s new discoveries</h2>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence in neuroscience allows us to open new doors into the human brain and mind.</p>
<p>New research signed by IBM to study <strong>neurodegenerative disorders</strong> was recently published in Cell Reports and summarized by Psychology Today.</p>
<p>This represents an advance in deep learning techniques, loosely <strong>modeled on the biological brain with layers of neural networks.</strong> These are typically solutions that require extensive training with huge data sets, which are then customized for specific domains. IBM research has enabled the development of <strong>evolutionary algorithms</strong> that can solve problems using little or even no data.</p>
<p>The different classes of evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, differential evolution, and estimation of distribution algorithms. What these classes have in common is the process of evolution, which involves the random generation of populations of search points, also called agents, chromosomes, and individuals.</p>
<p>Evolutionary algorithms are distributed in nature, which makes them more than suitable for cloud-based multi-core processing. The software has already been successfully used for research on Huntington&rsquo;s disease, in which researchers made use of a state-of-the-art NSDE algorithm hosted on the IBM Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="ai-and-neuroscience-what-to-expect-in-the-future">AI and neuroscience: what to expect in the future</h2>
<p>The opportunities of artificial intelligence applied to neuroscience are indeed significant. IDC estimates show that global spending on AI-based cognitive systems is expected to reach $57.6 billion by 2021. The current resurgence of artificial intelligence, largely due to deep learning, appears to be a global movement involving investments from companies, universities and governments around the world. Moreover, the global neuroscience market is expected to reach $30.8 billion by 2020. To date, venture capitalists, angel investors and pharmaceutical companies are making significant investments in startups in the field.</p>
<p>In the future, artificial intelligence is expected to lead to an increasing understanding of the human brain, the prevention of various neurodegenerative diseases and the treatment of psychological and psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><strong>So we just have to wait for new important developments for the existence of human beings.</strong></p>
