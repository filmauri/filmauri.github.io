<p>In a Vox article, <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22734772/future-animals-evolution-unexplainable?utm_source=pocket_mylist">(this one here)</a>, they interviewed biologists who told their opinion about the future evolution of animals?
What should we expect to see? Or tend not to see, since we&rsquo;d die sooner&hellip;.</p>

<p>Fully aquatic whale-rats. Praying mantises the size of dogs. We should expect all this, but how can we be able to make attendible predictions?
While it may seem at times that humanity is bent on destroying the environment, it is unlikely that our actions will end all life on Earth. Over time, they will adapt to a harsher world we helped create, evolving to meet the moment as best they can.</p>
<p>Some of these transformations began during our lifetime. Climate change, according to some research, is already &ldquo;shape-shifting&rdquo; animals.
No one knows exactly what changes in plants and animals will occur in the years ahead. Still, evolutionary biologists say it&rsquo;s worth trying to imagine what creatures will evolve in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a really useful and important exercise,&rdquo; says Liz Alter, a professor of evolutionary biology at California State University Monterey Bay.  In thinking about future animals, Alter says, we need to consider how we&rsquo;re changing the environment now.
At the very least, it&rsquo;s reassuring to know that life will almost certainly find a way, with or without us.</p>
<p>The pivotal question in Vox&rsquo;s article is about what animals will be around millions of years from now?</p>
<p>Some started by thinking about which animals living today are most likely to endure human-caused climate change and mass extinction.</p>
<p>Others started by imagining the potential environments of the future, and what adaptations might lead creatures to survive in them. A third group thought about the deep history of life on Earth, and what kinds of animals that once roamed the planet might return, in new forms, long after we are gone.</p>
<p>First, the survivors: &ldquo;These are rats, rodents, and even things like cockroaches and pigeons,&rdquo; said Jingmai O&rsquo;Connor, a paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. These animals &ldquo;are doing well despite the worst we&rsquo;re doing to this planet.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s impossible to predict what specific adaptations might emerge in which animals, but it&rsquo;s clear that when some species go extinct, they leave a gap in the food chain that can be filled by other species.</p>
<p>And if life on land becomes too harsh, the rats might be able to slowly adapt to water. Perhaps their evolutionary descendants will lose their fur or sprout fins, developing slender bodies suitable for a fully aquatic existence. Other marine mammals, such as seals and whales, have followed this path in their transition from land to water creatures.</p>
<p>Again, these specific evolutionary paths are pure speculation. But experts say they are in the realm of possibility.</p>
<h2 id="future-environments-that-will-shape-evolution">Future environments that will shape evolution</h2>
<p>The second way to think about the animals of the future is to imagine the environments of the future. Environments can drive evolution by exerting selection pressure, favoring some traits over others. For example, some birds evolved long, pointed beaks to extract nectar from flowers.</p>
<p>If nothing else, there will probably be plastic in the environment in the future as well. Of all the elements humans have introduced into the environment, plastic waste is already ubiquitous, and remnants of it could persist for millennia if humans continue to produce it as we have. Plastic is &ldquo;a great source of carbon, on which all living things depend,&rdquo; said Sahas Barve, an evolutionary ecologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Plastic, he added, could become food, and &ldquo;any animal that can exploit it will succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a way, this development would come full circle: Many plastics are made from petroleum, which is called a fossil fuel precisely because it comes from ancient, transmuted plant and animal remains. So new life forms could learn to eat the leftovers of the very, very old ones.</p>
<p>Termites could be one such creature. These insects already have a gut microbiome</p>
<p>Sharlene Santana, professor of biology at the University of Washington, considers how a bat species might evolve to live out of and around the oceans, which are sure to be more than they are today because of melting ice. Imagine a bat with a two-foot wingspan taking shape, able to glide like an albatross instead of flapping its wings, perhaps covering hundreds of miles in search of food or islands to roost on. It could use finely tuned echolocation to sense ripples in the water in order to spot fish. (In fact, some bats already do this).</p>
<h2 id="looking-to-the-past-to-predict-the-future">Looking to the past to predict the future</h2>
<p>Many of the scientists who spoke with Vox envisioned a future environment in which humans are no longer around. In doing so, they have often been inspired by animals that existed on Earth before our time - perhaps these types of creatures could make a comeback in the future.</p>
<p>If humans were to go extinct, our carbon emissions could still be in the air for a long time, said Alter, the Cal State professor of evolutionary biology. That could lead to boom times for plants, some of which can thrive in a CO2-dense atmosphere.</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesized that insect growth depends in part on the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere, which could lead insects to develop larger bodies, Alter said. So a future oxygen-rich world is one that might be able to foster religious mantids the size of rabbits, or &ldquo;ants the size of hummingbirds and dragonflies the size of hawks,&rdquo; Alter said.</p>
<p>Mairin Balisi, a paleoecologist at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, is thinking about what kinds of apex predators might rise to the top of the food chain if humanity dies out. To that end, she considers what predators existed before humans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we think of large predators only in North America, we think of gray wolves, the mountain lion or the grizzly bear,&rdquo; Balisi says. But large predators on the continent were much more common until about 12,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene or most recent ice age, with many species of saber-toothed cats and bone-crushing canines roaming the land.</p>
<h2 id="what-future-do-we-want">What future do we want?</h2>
<p>Modern humans have only been around for a few hundred thousand years, but what we do today is likely to have ripple effects on how the natural world will look tomorrow.</p>
<p>The evolution of life depends on the &ldquo;genetic and developmental toolkit&rdquo; as we know it today, says Santana, the University of Washington biologist. Because there is natural variation among animals, some are better at competing for resources and surviving, with less useful traits tending to fade away, while others sprout up with new adaptations. As species continue to go extinct, whether due to habitat loss, agriculture, poaching, or human-caused climate change, many potential sources of diverse life also go extinct from the future.</p>
<p>Scientists can still imagine a world in which animals that are endangered today continue and start new branches of the evolutionary tree. The future doesn&rsquo;t have to belong only to rats, pigeons, and insects. As long as manatees, polar bears, and monarch butterflies are around, for example, the possibility remains that their descendants will enter the scene in the future.</p>
<p>All of this is worth thinking about if we are to take full responsibility for our role in shaping the look and feel of the planet long after we are gone. When we imagine what creatures might come next, we can ask: What future do we want for the planet? How hard are we willing to work so that future generations of humans will still be around to live alongside us?</p>
<p>Giant insects evolving in the future would be &ldquo;really, really cool,&rdquo; Alter said. Especially, he added, &ldquo;if humans will actually be around to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while it&rsquo;s encouraging to imagine how different species might bounce back millions of years from now, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to stop investing in the life that&rsquo;s around us today,&rdquo; said Mychajliw, the Middlebury paleoecologist. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot we can do right now to make sure we&rsquo;re protecting species, protecting their genetic diversity and protecting their ability to respond to change.&rdquo;</p>
