<h2 id="daniel-kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</h2>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t give Nobel prizes by accident, so in my opinion it&rsquo;s worth listening to what Daniel Kahneman has to say.</p>
<p>His 2011 book, Thinking Fast And Slow, is about the two systems in our brains whose struggle over who&rsquo;s in charge makes us prone to mistakes and false decisions.</p>
<p>Here are 3 good lessons for knowing what&rsquo;s going on in your gray matter:</p>
<p>Your behavior is determined by 2 systems in your mind: one conscious and the other automatic.
Your brain is lazy and therefore prevents you from using the full power of your intelligence.
When making money decisions, leave your emotions at home.

<h2 id="the-two-systems-that-live-in-your-mind">The two systems that live in your mind</h2>
<p><strong>System 1</strong>  is the one that is used when someone enters the train and you <strong>instinctively</strong> turn towards the door but it is also the one that makes you eat the whole bag of chips in front of the TV when you could have just eaten one bowl</p>
<p>System 1 is a <strong>remnant of our past</strong> and is critical to our survival.Not having to think before you jump out of a car when the horn honks is quite useful, or taking, in advance, shopping bags when you go to shop without even thinking about it, don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>System 2</strong> on the other hand is very <strong>conscious, mindful and thoughtful</strong>.</p>
<p>It helps you exercise <strong>self-control</strong> and deliberately focus your attention.This system works when you meet a friend and try to spot them in a huge crowd of people, as it helps you remember what they look like and filter out all these other people.</p>
<p>System 2 <strong>is one of the &ldquo;newest&rdquo; additions</strong> to our brains and is only a few thousand years old. It is what helps us succeed in today&rsquo;s world where our priorities have shifted from getting food and shelter to earning money, supporting a family, and making many complex decisions.</p>
<p>However, these 2 systems don&rsquo;t just alternate perfectly or work together. <strong>They often fight over who is in charge and this conflict determines how you act and behave.</strong></p>
<h2 id="your-brain-is-lazy">Your brain is lazy</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple trick to show you how this conflict of 2 systems affects you, it&rsquo;s called the <strong>bat and ball problem.</strong></p>
<p>A baseball bat and a ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a second.</p>
<p>Done?</p>
<p>If your instantaneous, initial answer is $0.10, I&rsquo;m sorry to say that System 1 just fooled you.</p>
<p>try again, you will be luckier</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>After spending a minute or two thinking about it, you&rsquo;ll see that the ball must cost $0.05. So, if the bat costs $1 more, it comes to $1.05, which, combined, gives you $1.10.</p>
<p>Fascinating, isn&rsquo;t it? What happened here?</p>
<p>When system 1 faces a difficult problem it can&rsquo;t solve, it will call system 2 into action to work out the details. However, <strong>sometimes your brain perceives problems to be as simple as they actually are.</strong> System 1 thinks it can handle it, even though it really can&rsquo;t, and you end up <strong>making a mistake.</strong></p>
<p>Why does your brain do this? As with habits, it wants to save energy . The law of least effort states that your brain uses the minimum amount of energy for each task that it can get away with.</p>
<h2 id="the-heuristic-of-affect-how-we-feel-shapes-what-we-think">The heuristic of affect: how we feel shapes what we think</h2>
<p>We humans like to believe that we are rational beings, but the truth is that <strong>our reasoning is often controlled by how we feel.</strong></p>
<p>Affect heuristics say that <strong>we use our emotional state as a shortcut in decision making.</strong> How we feel about something changes which facts we will accept or reject about it. That&rsquo;s how our minds keep ideas consistent and coherent, so that our everyday choices are easier.</p>
<p>In one study, psychologist Paul Slovic found that when people were asked questions about new technologies such as water fluoridation, their opinions about the risks and benefits were unusually consistent. In other words, if they believed something was safe, they also believed it had great benefits. But if they believed something was risky, it was difficult for them to recognize the benefits.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, changing people&rsquo;s feelings on one side of the argument also changed their feelings on the other side. Convincing people of the benefits of a technology also made them less concerned about the risks.</p>
<h2 id="the-illusion-of-focus-we-overestimate-whatever-we-are-thinking-about">The illusion of focus: we overestimate whatever we are thinking about</h2>
<p>The illusion of focus is explained in the opening quote.</p>
<p>We in fact <strong>overestimate the effect of whatever we are focusing on at the moment.</strong></p>
<p>For example, did you know that paraplegics are no less happy than other people? This is hard for many people to believe, because right now we are focusing on the one main difference with paraplegics, which is not being able to use their legs.</p>
<p>However, in their daily lives, paraplegics themselves are NOT focused on that. They are focused on the other parts of life: a conversation, a movie, a frustration, etc. After about a year, paraplegics get used to their condition, which means they barely think about it, so it doesn&rsquo;t affect their happiness much .</p>
<p>Similarly, most of us have had the experience of buying a new car or gadget, feeling excited at first, only to have it fade into the background of our lives. This is a phenomenon that psychologist Daniel Gilbert has cleverly called miswanting .</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here is what I found most interesting about this book. What surprises me every time I read books of this kind is to discover, in everyday life, how useful it is to know more and more about how the brain works. In this way I can keep more and more under control my thoughts and so I can stay more focused and aware of what is happening around me. That&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>What do you think? <strong>Are you going to read it? I hope so!</strong></p>
