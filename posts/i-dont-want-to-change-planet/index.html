<p>I do not want to change planet.</p>
<p>The Metaverse is starting to be on everyone's lips, and plenty of people are hailing it as everything we've ever lacked, as something we already can't do without. Microsoft is offering previews of customized meeting rooms in which employees can be found in a totally virtual way. In reality, the possibilities that this brand new medium gives us are many and can also have useful implications for society.</p>
<p>In spite of this it seems to me that there are many more dangers or critical points. On the other hand, who wouldn't want to reduce to zero the time of travel and be in two places at the same time? Who wouldn't want to draw a new sky with their hands right from their room? Who wouldn't want to watch a Maldivian sunset on their comfortable couch in a room that recreates the atmospheric conditions of the desired atolls?
<p>The previously quoted article on the Metaverse, Tobias Van Schneider, stated back in 2016 that once he had spent a lot of time in the Metaverse and returned to life in non-virtual reality he experienced everything with a veil of sadness.  Returning to live in a reality where you can no longer play God must surely create a sense of discouragement and induce a perception of reality as a lesser, something that lacks a lot of possibilities. Reality is therefore already losing value, it is losing that fascination it has had in the last 4.5 billion years in each of its eras. The world is seen only as something to run away from, as a problem to be solved but much easier to circumvent. So why not go to Mars and do it all over again? Why not take refuge in your own homes to stop seeing all this pile of problems?</p>
<p>Someone who is always in touch with the power and beauty of this planet has noticed this trend now underway. A group of Icelanders have created the&rsquo;icelandverse, or rather, they haven&rsquo;t created anything at all. With a parody video of the Facebook Metaverse presentation, they have highlighted everything I have said so far.  I recommend you see it, I've linked it on the Press page.</p>
<p>Much of the time it would be enough to look at what we have around us. We need to find those moments when we stop and look at things and recognize that what we have around us we did not give to ourselves. Like the peasants of &ldquo;The Yellow Christ&rdquo; by Guaguin who during their working day stop in front of a crucifix and pray.</p>
<p>I too, like Jovanotti do not want to change planet, I want to live on this planet because this planet is a miracle. I absolutely recommend this docu-series by Jovanotti, you can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/aKJDDfl18xs">HERE. </a>  A series that takes its title from the&rsquo;last verse of &ldquo;The Lazy&rdquo; by Pablo Neruda, an ode to life, to this world.</p>
