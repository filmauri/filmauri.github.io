<p>&ldquo;Fragility is at the&rsquo;origin of understanding needs and sensitivity to understand how to help and be helped. A humanism driven to know one's fragility and to live it, not to hide it as if it were a weakness, a shameful discard for the desire for power, which is based on real strength and if anything on its prostheses. Shameful for an insane logic in which respect is equivalent to fear. A civilization where your fragility gives strength to that of another and falls on you by promoting social health that means serenity. Serenity, not the ephemeral happiness of a moment, but the continuous condition on which moments of intoxication can even be inserted. Fragility as the foundation of wisdom capable of recognizing that the wealth of the individual is the other, and that alone we are not even men, but only misanthropes who have misinterpreted their lives and that of the social whole.
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fragility is at the origin of the understanding of needs and sensitivity to understand how to help and be helped&rdquo;.
So says Vittorino Andreoli in his book &ldquo;L&rsquo;glass man. The strength of fragility&rdquo;. Starting from this statement, he outlines the role of fragility within a society that asks to be strong, to resist in the face of suffering by continuing to repeat: "Everything will be all right to the end".
<h2 id="the-dictatorship-of-terror">The Dictatorship of Terror</h2>
<p>The psychiatrist argues that it is necessary to know one's fragility and not to live it as something to be ashamed of and hide. It often happens that one feels a great expectation on oneself. By our nature we are inclined to seek consensus in the other and then try to make his expectations come true. This dynamic also happens in the school environment because we do not want to show our difficulties. This leads to close oneself in a bubble in which you convince yourself of something false as that your fragility is to be hidden.
<p>In the classroom, therefore, there is a dictatorship of terror, a terror created by the students who, ironically, are also the terrorized. Since they are committed to not being seen as fragile and finished, they don't remember to be surprised by what they are told, but they immediately move on to thinking about how they can memorize that notion.</p> <p>They are the ones who are terrified.
<h2 id="a-fragile-civilization">A Fragile Civilization</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You therefore need &quot; a civilization where your fragility gives strength to that of another&rdquo;. Again, the classroom is the place where the truth of this statement is most glaring. Often the question posed to the professor is experienced as a moment in which one's own fragility is exposed. Showing yourself for what you are can only help your fragility and that of all those around you. In this way, seeing that one's question is at the heart of the professor and in general of the one to whom it has been asked, one lives with &ldquo;serenity&rdquo; the dictatorship of terror falls and one begins to conceive of fragility as something useful even to one's own happiness.</p>
<p>It is a difficult position to have since in admitting one's finiteness, pride is wounded. However, it is tangible &ldquo;the strength of fragility&rdquo;. What seems like a lack is actually what more than anything else can ennoble one's soul.</p>.
<h2 id="√©-sapiente-solo-chi-sa-di-non-sapere">He is wise only who knows not to know</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fragility as the foundation of wisdom&rdquo;. This is what Socrates also affirmed by saying: &ldquo;He is wise only who knows not to know and so ignores even his own ignorance&rdquo;. By showing oneself in one's own fragility, one is able to remain in a position of openness towards the new and the different. In fact, Socrates, maintaining this openness of mind could not find someone who knew more than him. Recognizing oneself as fragile is therefore the true &ldquo;foundation of wisdom&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I recognize that continually admitting such a lack is difficult since it is a continuous impact against one's own finiteness. What is generated by such an impact, however, is not destruction and nothingness but serenity and wisdom.</p> <p>The position described in the book is not the same as the position described in the book.
<p>The position described by Vittorino Andreoli is very similar to the one outlined by Nassim Taleb in his book:&ldquo;Antifragile, thriving in disorder&rdquo;. This essay focuses on the importance of Antifragility: a position for which the clash with one's own finiteness generates something better. Something that is fragile, however, if subjected to a shock, breaks and something robust always remains the same as itself. it is necessary to lay bare, accept their frailties and take them as an opportunity for improvement. &ldquo;[&hellip;] alone you are not even men, but only misanthropes who have misinterpreted their lives and that of the social whole&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Life is not in fact a competition to show oneself perfect and respectable by hiding all one's mistakes, as it happened in the England of Queen Victoria and as it still happens, but rather a place, a path where one can put oneself to the test in order to participate entirely in one's own humanity.</p>
