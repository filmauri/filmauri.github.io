      <description>I find myself putting this thought in writing on a night seemingly like many others. What prompted me to talk about this is a chapter in &amp;ldquo;The Four Loves&amp;rdquo; by C.S.Lewis called Friendship.
With this return to less restrictive measures I am discovering again what is the root of a friendship, what truly makes me say: &amp;ldquo;These are my friends.&amp;rdquo; From a biological point of view, friendship is the least natural of all affections.</description>

      <description>What causes us to make decisions in life? We think the answer is obvious. People know what&amp;rsquo;s good for them. They weigh their options and make a rational decision! When a waiter in a diner asks if you&amp;rsquo;d like to order dessert after a meal the answer is easy. My belly isn&amp;rsquo;t full + I love sweets = of course I&amp;rsquo;d like dessert! In other words, YOU make YOUR OWN decisions.</description>

      <description>Can you play video games using your brain as a controller? The answer is yes
Neuralink, a company founded by Elon Musk in 2016, has recently been all over the news as it has managed to do something extremely fascinating.
In fact, they managed to get a monkey to play a video game, albeit a simple one compared to more modern video games. Well but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there.</description>

      <description>Want to have a site similar to mine without spending a dime? Do you want it a little more beautiful? Then you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place! A few days ago I had a few hours free during an afternoon and I wanted to try my hand at what I thought was one of the greatest feats in human history. Well, thank goodness, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as hard as I thought it would be.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
I am writing this page not knowing what will become of this project.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure something will come to me though. What made me start this blog even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what would become of it is the book: Start Now, Get Perfect Later by Rob Moore. I listened to the summary of it on 4books, a startup by Marco Montemagno, and it convinced me. The fundamental message is the one expressed in the title.</description>
