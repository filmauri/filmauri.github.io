      <title>AI and neuroscience towards a deeper insight of human brain</title>

      <description>​ It was back in the year 2000 when Mel Gibson, in the movie What Women Want, due to a small accident had managed to find out what women really thought. Pure fantasy, of course, but in 2021 we can finally say that understanding the human brain is possible and all thanks to the use of artificial intelligence in the field of neuroscience.
Researchers at MIT are working on segmenting the anatomical structures of the human brain, automating the process thanks to AI, while IBM has created a cloud-based neuroscience model for studying neurodegenerative disorders, using algorithms that mimic biological evolution to find solutions to factually complex problems.</description>

      <title>Dyson spheres, The key to resurrection and immortality?</title>

      <description>​
In a 2018 paper, researchers Alexey Turchin and Maxim Chernyakov published a paper outlining various ways humans might someday be able to achieve immortality or resurrection.
One way involves creating a simulated afterlife, in which artificial intelligence would build simulations of past human lives. Getting the necessary power for the simulation might require building a Dyson sphere, which is a theoretical megastructure that orbits a star and captures its energy.</description>

      <description>Are people born good and then corrupted by society or born bad and then made good by society?
This is the question that &amp;ldquo;The Goodness Paradox&amp;rdquo; by Richard Wrangham begins with.
This is more than just a philosophical question and many Religious people have different thoughts on it. Hobbes would say that we are all selfish and bad from birth, while Rousseau claimed that we were all born good. Scientists have tried to answer this question by giving ethic tests to infants.</description>

      <description>A huge amount of data made available to anyone who wants to look for possible alien signals: if there is an ET hiding among us, we will find it.
  Breakthrough Listen   The Breakthrough Listen Initiative has recently published the report of the most comprehensive survey ever conducted on radio emissions from the Milky Way and in particular from the region around the black hole at the center of our galaxy.</description>

      <description>Again, I am writing during a night like many others. Unlike the last &amp;ldquo;Personal Thoughts&amp;rdquo; this thought of mine originated from nothing other than what I am experiencing.
It is impossible that at this moment in history a person does not have an impelling desire for life. I feel an immense tension towards life, towards action and sharing. The need, the desire fights against nothingness, against skepticism. In this moment in Italy the situation is fairly quiet in terms of contagions.</description>

      <description>The universe we live in could be very large but limited or it could be infinitely large.
Physicist Brian Greene says that if the second option is the true one then so is something else: there are so many ways matter can organize itself within that infinite universe. But, in the end, matter must repeat itself and organize itself in similar ways. So, if the universe is infinitely large, it is also home to infinite parallel universes.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of Perseverance, the NASA rover that landed on Mars on February 18. Along with it came a small drone called Ingenuity that made history on April 19. In fact, never before that day had a craft managed to hover over another planet. Due to the distance from Mars, scientists monitoring the drone had to wait more than 3 hours to get the data from the experiment. Such a great distance in fact does not allow the flying of the drone, even the transmitted light reflected from Mars takes tens of minutes to reach us.</description>

      <description>I find myself putting this thought in writing on a night seemingly like many others. What prompted me to talk about this is a chapter in &amp;ldquo;The Four Loves&amp;rdquo; by C.S.Lewis called Friendship.
With this return to less restrictive measures I am discovering again what is the root of a friendship, what truly makes me say: &amp;ldquo;These are my friends.&amp;rdquo; From a biological point of view, friendship is the least natural of all affections.</description>

      <description>What causes us to make decisions in life? We think the answer is obvious. People know what&amp;rsquo;s good for them. They weigh their options and make a rational decision! When a waiter in a diner asks if you&amp;rsquo;d like to order dessert after a meal the answer is easy. My belly isn&amp;rsquo;t full + I love sweets = of course I&amp;rsquo;d like dessert! In other words, YOU make YOUR OWN decisions.</description>

      <description>Can you play video games using your brain as a controller? The answer is yes
Neuralink, a company founded by Elon Musk in 2016, has recently been all over the news as it has managed to do something extremely fascinating.
In fact, they managed to get a monkey to play a video game, albeit a simple one compared to more modern video games. Well but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there.</description>

      <description>Want to have a site similar to mine without spending a dime? Do you want it a little more beautiful? Then you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place! A few days ago I had a few hours free during an afternoon and I wanted to try my hand at what I thought was one of the greatest feats in human history. Well, thank goodness, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as hard as I thought it would be.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
I am writing this page not knowing what will become of this project.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure something will come to me though. What made me start this blog even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what would become of it is the book: Start Now, Get Perfect Later by Rob Moore. I listened to the summary of it on 4books, a startup by Marco Montemagno, and it convinced me. The fundamental message is the one expressed in the title.</description>
