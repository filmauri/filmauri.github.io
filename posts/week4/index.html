			<p>Every time I start writing these pages I find myself lost looking back over the week. However, writing it down helps me gain clarity in what I&rsquo;ve been through and makes me start the next week with more awareness, as far as possible. It was a tough week. Whenever it is, critical questions are forced upon us. The reality of the facts imposes them on us. Faced with such big questions, I find myself feeling discouraged and annihilated. It is easy to stop living under the weight of the world that you believe to be on your shoulders.
It takes a deep breath to take a step back from the abyss into which we are thrown and be able to look at it for what it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you look long into the <strong>abyss</strong>, the <strong>abyss</strong> looks back into you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the main risk, that our life becomes the abyss into which we have been thrown. Right now we need to remember to be loved, to have friends and people After all, we are all human and we share the same joys and sorrows. In short.
The state of the world is troubling and we all realize it. War is a big part of the abyss before which we are placed. In the face of this, it is clear that we do not have much power over the world even though we believe the contrary, feeling that we are the masters of the world. So what to do with the time that is given to us? What to do with one&rsquo;s life in such a moment? What is one&rsquo;s contribution to the world?
These are questions that are imposed by life and that I can&rsquo;t help but look at. It is difficult to understand how what one is forced to live is related to the good of the world. Undoubtedly school is a big part of my days, but what does it have to do with the world? What kind of good can it do to the world? And therefore, for what/who do I do what I do?
I leave these questions of meaning to you as well.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find time to read, to fall in love with the things that happen to us and that we discover. However, we must be able to do it, we must never stop falling in love, love is the engine that moves the world.
  Nevertheless, I found some articles that interested me and I recommend you to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/da-mosca-mons-pezzi-dove-il-perdono-che-non-sappiamo-darci/2302396/">Where is the forgiveness that we do not know how to give ourselves</a></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@absurdistan/the-absurdity-of-the-war-in-ukraine-c9c55be1842">The Absurdity of the War in Ukraine</a>Medium is a well of these articles, by relatively random people but allowing you to have many opinions.</p>
<p><a href="https://fs.blog/yuval-noah-harari-dominate-earth/">Why We Dominate the Earth</a>Article from another blog, a bit more important than the one you&rsquo;re reading. Slowly we will get through it, I believe in your power of sharing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a way to have articles worthy of being called articles. Creating an idea of things is perhaps the hardest thing today, where war is also waged with information and non-information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.repubblica.it/cultura/2022/02/04/news/l_intervista_il_filosofo_byong-chul_han_i_rischi_di_un_era_in_cui_non_si_vive_ma_si_digita_-336470816/">The risks of an era in which you don&rsquo;t live but you type</a>This is an interview with Byung-Chul Han, who has been quoted several times in the last weeks. I recommend you to read also the book recommended in this article. Short, concise and effective.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading the article again this week, catch up on old articles too!</p>
<p>Have a good week</p>
