<p>How to solve the queue on the streets of Rome and the interminable traffic jams in London? There can be several ways, one of them is <strong>the prediction of people&rsquo;s movements.</strong> Predicting what people will do will make it much easier to organize a road system and the services people need to get around.</p>
<p>The most used model for forecasting mobility flows is the so-called <strong>&ldquo;gravitational model&rdquo;</strong> that analyzes both the movements of people on foot and by vehicles. In real life, however, this model has often proved inaccurate.
For this reason <strong>Deep Gravity</strong> has been developed, a new forecasting model that improves many aspects of the previous model.</p>
<p>The gravitational model takes its name as an inspiration from I<strong>saac Newton&rsquo;s law of universal gravitation</strong>. It states that the flow of mobility between two places, for example two neighborhoods of a city, is proportional to their population and inversely proportional to their geographical distance.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on Newtonian laws of gravity physics, physical bodies are transformed into activities of mass proportional to their size. This idea was established at the end of the nineteenth century and then after the Second World War, extending the application of the gravitational model to other spatial phenomena such as travelers movements or telephone calls between cities.
The weaknesses of the gravitational model and the improvements of Deep Gravity.</p>
<p>In practice, the gravitational model is often inaccurate because it is based on only two variables, namely distance and population, and is unable to capture complex relationships between them.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the Institute of Science and Information Technology of the National Research Council together with the Bruno Kessler Foundation of Trento and Argonne National Laboratory in the U.S., has developed &ldquo;Deep Gravity&rdquo;,<strong>an algorithm that adds to the gravitational model two key ingredients, thus improving the accuracy</strong>. The result is a research published in Nature entitled A Deep Gravity model for mobility flows generation.</p>
<p>The two added elements are the use of different variables that <strong>describe points of interest in a place such as restaurants, hotels, hospitals and roads, and the ability to capture complex relationships between these variables through the use of deep learning.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Experiments conducted across three countries (Italy, England and New York State) have shown that Deep Gravity can predict flows with an accuracy that is up to a thousand times better than that of the gravity model,&rdquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For example, places with a large number of food, retail and industrial facilities attract more commuters than places with health-related points of interest and commercial use. In addition, motivation in movements between two locations is not symmetrical: the points of interest that drive movements from place A to place B are not necessarily the same as those that drive movements from B to A. This study is an important step toward explaining complex phenomena such as human mobility with relevant practical implications such as calculating the probability of spread of an epidemic, such as Covid-19, based on points of interest in a territory.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be the next frontier of travel optimization but it could also be the next frontier of loss of privacy. If travel detection is also combined with facial recognition, as is happening in China, our privacy will be undone. The state will always be aware of where we are and where we are going, what our habits are. It will be a big brother&hellip; <strong>Are we willing to give up all our freedom to save a few minutes in traffic?</strong></p>
