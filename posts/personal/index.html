			<p>I find myself putting this thought in writing on a night seemingly like many others. What prompted me to talk about
this is a chapter in <a href="https://www.amazon.it/quattro-amori-Affetto-amicizia-carit%C3%A0/dp/8816371269/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=i+four+loves&amp;qid=1617179496&amp;sr=8-1">&ldquo;The Four Loves&rdquo;</a> by C.S.Lewis called <strong>Friendship.</strong></p>
<p>With this return to less restrictive measures I am discovering again what is the root of a friendship, what truly makes me say:
&ldquo;These are my friends.&rdquo; From a biological point of view, friendship <strong>is the least natural of affections.</strong> If you think about it, seeing a
If you think about it, seeing a friend is very different from seeing the person you are in love with. Just think of the reaction your body has!</p>
<p>When two people become friends they take, together, a different path than that of the herd composed of all the others. Two friends
never talk about what binds them but they know more than anyone else, they know perfectly well why they are bound together. This affection
not playing a key role in the biological world, allows us to choose our friends by recognizing in them an attractiveness. More
affection is intrinsic in humans the less easy it is to list the reasons for its presence.</p>
<p>The group of friends has a dynamic that nowhere else can be found. The &ldquo;members&rdquo; are bonded in a crazy way.
Lamb says that if of 3 friends (A, B, C) were to die A then B would not only lose A but also the part of &ldquo;A in C&rdquo;.
<strong>In each of my friends there is something that only another friend can fully bring out.</strong> In a friendly context
there is no jealousy over anything; as Dante says, &ldquo;Behold, he will grow our loves,&rdquo; for in this love &ldquo;<strong>sharing</strong>
<strong>does not mean to lose</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing that has amazed me most in my rediscovery, with help from Lewis, of friendship is a fact that is extremely paradoxical.
In friendship what binds people together is to cherish the truth itself and to seek it together. What is not necessary, and here
lies the great characteristic of friendship, is that it is not necessary for your friend to agree with you on the answer to that truth.
What really matters is wanting to understand more about something. This logically implies that you can only get to have friends
as long as you want something else besides them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He who possesses nothing can share nothing; he who is going nowhere can have no fellow travelers&rdquo; (C.S.Lewis)</p>
