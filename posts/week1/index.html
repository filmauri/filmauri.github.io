<p>A lot has been changing in the last while about how I use social. They&rsquo;ve always been a way to take my mind off things and get into a parallel world of ad, gifted and shit. I was starting to feel like it was time wasted so I started decluttering through my instagram followings, the only social I had. I wanted to make sure I was following my friends and profiles that could add value to the time I was spending on social media and not take away from it. I tried but the result was not the best, the &ldquo;Explore&rdquo; section is just a black hole that draws you in and out after half an hour (when it&rsquo;s good) not even knowing your name. So I decided to uninstall Instagram. Now I only use it for <a href="">filippo.im</a>.
Now the social I use the most is <a href="https://twitter.com/filippo_mauri">twitter</a>. Its &ldquo;Explore&rdquo; section is also done well. But for real. It shows you what people are talking about around the world and what the &ldquo;hot topics&rdquo; of the moment are. Also the type of posts and people using twitter helps you use social as a means of information and building a personal opinion about the world.
I then discovered <a href="https://medium.com/">medium</a>, a social where the posts are articles about whatever. Truly a great idea that of medium. If I had known about it before, maybe instead of opening a blog and spending a thousand hours tweaking it to get it to go the way I wanted, I would have just made an account on medium and I would have been on my way.
There is also a comments section on the articles where you can discuss. Never have I found comments to be much more useful than the article itself. I read an <a href="https://medium.com/@joashxu/how-i-take-notes-591b642c010d">article</a> about how some guy, Joash Xu, obviously unknown, was taking notes. It seemed like a very organized thing and I was already downloading all the apps he used to be able to match such perfection and organization.
Reading the comments I see that one word is often repeated.<a href="https://obsidian.md/"> Obisidian, Obsidian, Obsidian</a>. And I say, beautiful there, what is it?
A world opened up to me. How the heck had I never heard that before? I had no idea and yet the world around it is gigantic. Just think, I&rsquo;m writing this article right now in Obisidian. I suggest you to have a look at it because it has turned my note-taking around (LaTex will never leave you, though&hellip;). It has a lot of crazy features that you can discover in this <a href="https://youtu.be/QgbLb6QCK88">video</a>.
I discovered the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">Zettelkasten</a>, a way of taking notes to remember things better. In short, a great app that I&rsquo;ve already had a chance to recommend to my friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also had a lot of other falls in love like blockchain and world <a href="https://opensea.io/">NFT</a>, app development, ML (which I&rsquo;m doing in school), university. There will be time to talk about everything. Now it&rsquo;s off to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today we communicate so maniacally and excessively precisely because we are alone, because we feel an emptiness. Such over-communication is not fulfilling, however. It only aggravates loneliness, for it lacks the presence of the Other.&rdquo;
<em>Byung-Chul Han, &ldquo;The Non-Things.&quot;</em></p>
