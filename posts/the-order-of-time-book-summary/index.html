<strong>&ldquo;The Order of Time&rdquo;</strong> is a book written by <strong>Carlo Rovelli</strong>, theoretical physicist and author.
Probably, to make a review on a book about quantum physics is not for me the bread and butter but I will try anyway.</p>

<p>In this book it is clear that <strong>we are talking about time</strong> and Rovelli progressively reveals its substantial nature. Nature that however remains elusive by the usual methods of investigation or better to say, the time is disassembled and deconstructed to take paradoxically, a form &ldquo;without clear contours&rdquo;. Basically we arrive at a concept of time that is stratified, complex and that is much more related to us and to dimensions yet to be explored.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder is the source of our desire to know, and discovering that time is not as we thought opens a thousand questions. [&hellip;] Why do we remember the past and not the future? Do we exist in time or does time exist in us? What does it really mean that time &ldquo;flows&rdquo;? What ties time to our nature as subjects? What do I hear when I listen to the flow of time?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Einstein&rsquo;s theory of general relativity, <strong>it has been shown that there is no single time, but countless &ldquo;times,&rdquo; the first veil is removed that makes time lose its uniqueness and with it its absoluteness.</strong></p>
<p>An interesting point that sets two contrasting visions is in the fourth chapter, where Aristotle is in antithesis with Newton.
The former believes that things change all the time and that time is the measure of change. However, for Aristotle, <em>&ldquo;If nothing moves, there is no time, because time is only the trace of movement&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>Newton, on the contrary, while recognizing that there is time as a measure of days and movements, <strong>asserts that there must also be a &ldquo;true&rdquo; time, which flows independently of things and their movements.</strong> Therefore, for Newton, if everything would stop, if even the inner movements would become motionless, there would be the &ldquo;true&rdquo; time that would continue to pass as an unperturbed substrate.</p>
<p>It will be <strong>Einstein</strong> to put an end to the theoretical diatribe, with an ingenious synthesis of his curved spacetime (the gravitational field).
From him on time will be described no longer as an elastic canvas of spacetime, but &ldquo;quanta&rdquo; that fluctuate and can only have certain values and others not.
The three discoveries of quantum mechanics that definitely demolish the idea of time previously predefined are: granularity, indeterminacy and relational aspect of physical variables.</p>
<p><strong>Time is quantized,</strong> i.e. it is granular and not continuous as it has always been seen. Below a measurement threshold that is &ldquo;Planck time&rdquo;, time is so minute, so &ldquo;minified&rdquo; that it no longer exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, there is a minimum interval of time. Below it, the notion of time does not exist even in its most stripped-down sense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what left me most stunned when I read it: there is no objective global present.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[&hellip;] there is no such thing as an objective global present,&rdquo; to me is another key that needs to be fixed well in order to understand what has been discussed so far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statement makes one question the whole reality, one wonders what is real and what is not&hellip;, but the basic error is that one tries to explain reality with inadequate terms and an unsuitable grammar. The fact that in the world there is not a global order of events, does not mean that everything is illusory, it means that temporal relations between events are more complex than we believed.
An event that may have already been for me, may still be for another person. <strong>Past and future lose their universal meaning.</strong></p>

<p>At a certain point Rovelli talks about the blurred vision of the world theory for which there are physical interactions that remain unknown to us that blur the vision of the world, through which we arrive at the concept of entropy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the blur comes the concepts of heat and entropy, and to these are related the phenomena that characterize the flow of time. The entropy of a system, in particular, depends explicitly on the blur. It depends on what I don&rsquo;t see, because it depends on the number of indistinguishable configurations. The same microscopic configuration can be high entropy with respect to one blur, low entropy with respect to another. Blurring in turn is not a mental construct: it depends on the actual physical interaction, so the entropy of a system depends on the physical interaction with the system. This does not mean that entropy is an arbitrary or subjective quantity. It means that it is a relative quantity, like velocity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, the author brings forward the idea that the entropy of the world depends not only on its configuration, but also on how we are relating to it and how we interact with its variables. And what determines this? That the arrow of time (the initial low entropy of the universe), <strong>may be due to us, rather than the universe.</strong></p>
<p>For those who are passionate about quantum physics, physics in general and the questions it poses, reading this book in my opinion can not miss.</p>
<p>Those who wonder about the mystery of time, its nature and interaction with everyday life, will surely discover a new way to observe and perceive the flow of minutes.</p>
<p>An excerpt from the concluding chapters reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Physics helps us penetrate layers of the mystery. It shows how the temporal structure of the world differs from our intuition. It gives us hope that we can study the nature of time by freeing ourselves from the fog caused by our emotions. But in the search for time, further and further away from us, we may have ended up finding something of ourselves, like Copernicus, who thought he was studying the movements of the heavens and ended up understanding how the Earth was moving beneath his feet. In the end, perhaps the emotion of time is not the screen of fog that prevents us from seeing the objective nature of time. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is to us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
