Scientists have now created the <strong>world&rsquo;s first living</strong>, self-healing robots using frog stem cells.
Scientists have named these new creatures as <strong>Xenobots,</strong> referring to the African frog from which they get their stem cells. These little things are tiny, as small as half a millimeter, which allows them to walk and swim, survive for weeks without food and work in teams.</p>

<p>The researchers scrapped live stem cells from frog embryos and left them in incubation. <strong>Later, like Legos, they were assembled to form body shapes under the guidance of supercomputers.</strong></p>
<p>The cells then began to work on their own: skin cells came together to form the structure, while pulsating heart muscle cells allowed the robot to move on its own. Xenobots also have self-healing capabilities; when the scientists sliced a robot, it healed itself and kept moving.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;These are new living machines,&quot;</strong> Joshua Bongard, one of the lead researchers at the University of Vermont, said in the press release. &ldquo;They are neither a traditional robot nor a known species of animal. It&rsquo;s a new class of artifact: a living, programmable organism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xenobots don&rsquo;t look like traditional robots - they don&rsquo;t have gears or robotic arms. Instead, they look more like a small garble of pink flesh in motion. The researchers say this is deliberate - this &ldquo;biological machine&rdquo; can achieve things that typical steel and plastic robots can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As biological machines, xenobots are safer for human health, so much so that they could be used for a lot of different tasks. For example.
to clean up radioactive waste, collect microplastics in the oceans, transport medicine inside human bodies, or even travel through our arteries to scrape up plaque. Xenobots can survive in aqueous environments without additional nutrients for days or weeks - making them suitable for internal drug delivery.
Aside from these immediate practical tasks, <strong>xenobots could also help researchers learn more about cell biology - opening the door to future advances in human health and longevity.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If we could create 3D biological forms on demand, we could repair birth defects, reprogram tumors into normal tissue, regenerate after traumatic injuries or degenerative diseases, and defeat aging,&rdquo; the researchers' website said. This research could have &ldquo;a huge impact on regenerative medicine (building body parts and inducing regeneration).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may sound like something out of a dystopian science fiction movie, but the researchers say there&rsquo;s no need to be alarmed.
The organisms are preloaded with their food source of lipid and protein stores, allowing them to live for a little over a week - but they can&rsquo;t reproduce or evolve. However, their lifespan can increase to several weeks in nutrient-rich environments.
And although the supercomputer - a powerful piece of artificial intelligence - plays an important role in building these robots, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; that the AI could have malicious intentions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment, however, it&rsquo;s hard to see how an AI could create harmful organisms more easily than a talented biologist with bad intentions could&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
