 “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it”
 Daniel Kahneman You certainly don&amp;rsquo;t give Nobel prizes by accident, so in my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s worth listening to what Daniel Kahneman has to say.
His 2011 book, Thinking Fast And Slow, is about the two systems in our brains whose struggle over who&amp;rsquo;s in charge makes us prone to mistakes and false decisions.</description>

  Summer finally arrives and it&amp;rsquo;s already over. Well come on, there&amp;rsquo;s still quite a while to go before we have to return to the daily grind. We still have a lot of free time to make use of. It&amp;rsquo;s in free time that one really understands what one wants. Vacation is the noblest time of the year, because it&amp;rsquo;s the time when one either commits to what he wants with the value he recognizes as prevalent in his life or he doesn&amp;rsquo;t commit to anything at all and then it&amp;rsquo;s a fool&amp;rsquo;s errand.</description>
