      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of Perseverance, the NASA rover that landed on Mars on February 18. Along with it came a small drone called Ingenuity that made history on April 19. In fact, never before that day had a craft managed to hover over another planet. Due to the distance from Mars, scientists monitoring the drone had to wait more than 3 hours to get the data from the experiment. Such a great distance in fact does not allow the flying of the drone, even the transmitted light reflected from Mars takes tens of minutes to reach us.</description>
