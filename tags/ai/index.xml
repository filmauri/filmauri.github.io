  In the 90′s, neuroscientist Melvyn Goodale began studying people with a condition called visual form agnosia. These individuals can&amp;rsquo;t consciously see the shape or orientation of objects, but they act as if they can.
 &amp;ldquo;If you hold a pencil in front of them and ask them if it&amp;rsquo;s horizontal or vertical, they can&amp;rsquo;t tell, but, amazingly, they can reach out and grab that pencil, correctly orienting their hand as they reach to make contact with it.</description>

      <description>​ It was back in the year 2000 when Mel Gibson, in the movie What Women Want, due to a small accident had managed to find out what women really thought. Pure fantasy, of course, but in 2021 we can finally say that understanding the human brain is possible and all thanks to the use of artificial intelligence in the field of neuroscience.
Researchers at MIT are working on segmenting the anatomical structures of the human brain, automating the process thanks to AI, while IBM has created a cloud-based neuroscience model for studying neurodegenerative disorders, using algorithms that mimic biological evolution to find solutions to factually complex problems.</description>
