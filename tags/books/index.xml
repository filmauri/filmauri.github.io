      <description>Again, I am writing during a night like many others. Unlike the last &amp;ldquo;Personal Thoughts&amp;rdquo; this thought of mine originated from nothing other than what I am experiencing.
It is impossible that at this moment in history a person does not have an impelling desire for life. I feel an immense tension towards life, towards action and sharing. The need, the desire fights against nothingness, against skepticism. In this moment in Italy the situation is fairly quiet in terms of contagions.</description>

      <description>I find myself putting this thought in writing on a night seemingly like many others. What prompted me to talk about this is a chapter in &amp;ldquo;The Four Loves&amp;rdquo; by C.S.Lewis called Friendship.
With this return to less restrictive measures I am discovering again what is the root of a friendship, what truly makes me say: &amp;ldquo;These are my friends.&amp;rdquo; From a biological point of view, friendship is the least natural of all affections.</description>
