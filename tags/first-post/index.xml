      <description>Hi everyone!
I am writing this page not knowing what will become of this project.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure something will come to me though. What made me start this blog even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what would become of it is the book: Start Now, Get Perfect Later by Rob Moore. I listened to the summary of it on 4books, a startup by Marco Montemagno, and it convinced me. The fundamental message is the one expressed in the title.</description>
