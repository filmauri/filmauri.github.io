      <description>Are people born good and then corrupted by society or born bad and then made good by society?
This is the question that &amp;ldquo;The Goodness Paradox&amp;rdquo; by Richard Wrangham begins with.

Scientists have tried to answer this question by giving ethic tests to infants.</description>
