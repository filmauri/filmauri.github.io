<p>Today we&rsquo;re talking about a book that might be useful to most of you. It just came out in English and it&rsquo;s called <strong>&ldquo;The Only Study Guide You&rsquo;ll Ever Need&rdquo; by Jade Bowl.</strong>
Jade, UnJaded Jade on social media, is a student like many others who wants to use her time in the best possible way.
I, too, have often found myself looking for <strong>ways to balance both pleasure and duty.</strong> This book, however, is not a bunch of nonsense that comes from the thoughts of a random girl, but all the things she proposes are <em>well-founded and evidence-based</em>.</p>

<p>This book is a combination of <strong>revision methods, techniques for productivity</strong> and all these things that you don&rsquo;t really get in school but are pretty essential to getting that information in your head and being able to do well in exams. It has a more holistic approach than all the other books written about this topic. So it looks at things that affect you as a student, like perfectionism, fear of failure, mental health, and talking about her own experience.</p>
<p>The Internet would probably define productivity is anything where you get tangible output, which is economic activity. It&rsquo;s you studying, it&rsquo;s you putting in time for a better grade. It&rsquo;s making more money that&rsquo;s often classically seen as productive.</p>
<p>For Jade, though, <strong>productivity is just spending time well.</strong> And that&rsquo;s something She dig into in this book. Being productive could be spending time with friends, it can be selfcare or recharging. Even if that just means enjoying your life, that&rsquo;s also productive.</p>
<p>I think of productivity is doing more of the things that matter to you. And so to me, I consider productive when I don&rsquo;t want to be doing something else.</p>
<p>Jade suggests the 3F&rsquo;s method to succeed in being productive, to be three times more productive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus - like deep focus, getting in the zone.</li>
<li>Forethought - So how you plan your activity.</li>
<li>Fun - So enjoying what you&rsquo;re doing, loving it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing activities, you tend to do them in a certain place. When you go to the kitchen, your brain is thinking: I&rsquo;m gonna cook or I&rsquo;m gonna eat. When you&rsquo;re on your bed, you&rsquo;re thinking generally, I&rsquo;m gonna go to sleep. And so when you&rsquo;re doing certain activities, like studying or writing this book, you should try and keep a sanctity over the space you&rsquo;re doing it in. So you kind of have a choice. <strong>When you&rsquo;re at your desk, you can make that a place where you scroll on your phone and go on social media.</strong>
Or you can try and commit to making it a place where you revise that chapter of biology, or you work on a project of some kind. And this was really essential for her for being able to finish this book because She had a cafe where she would go to and whenever she was there, she wouldn&rsquo;t bring a friend so she would just sit and write.</p>
<p>It can be so hard to find when you&rsquo;ve got so many different elements of your life that you&rsquo;re juggling. So I find that intentionality: I am coming here to do one task is really useful.</p>
<h2 id="forethought">Forethought</h2>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of a mouthful, that one. But the whole idea is <strong>planning and how essential that is,</strong> because so often we block out a time to sit and study. But if you haven&rsquo;t planned what you&rsquo;re going to study or how to study it effectively, you might just end up kind of wasting time. You sit there and, you know, you need to learn this information, but you don&rsquo;t really know how to learn. So there are some things I&rsquo;ve discussed in my book, one of which is a framework to understand how we learn and plan better revision techniques.</p>
<p>So the idea is that if you&rsquo;re sad when you&rsquo;re revising, you can change it to the pneumonic. She introduces <strong>SAAD</strong>. And this is all based off of different research papers about what works for science of memory, and <strong>the S stands for spaced repetition</strong>. When you are learning something, you actually exponentially will forget that information if you don&rsquo;t go over and review it. And so the idea is you just review that information at regular intervals, you&rsquo;re more likely to retain it.</p>
<p>And then the second one is <strong>active recall.</strong> So I think what&rsquo;s so so hard and what feels often productive for people is to spend more time revising but doing passive activities like highlighting or rereading a textbook. You&rsquo;re just staring at information. So feels like you&rsquo;re spending your time well, when in reality giving it a bit of forethought to plan an active recall religion technique is what is going to give you the most benefit.
So the idea is you&rsquo;re pulling information out of your mind. So if you&rsquo;re trying to recall a process you are actually going and bringing it out of your head is you going over that information. It&rsquo;s better than just reading it.</p>
<p>The third one is <strong>Association.</strong> So the idea is that when you&rsquo;re learning, you tend to build it off of the foundation and the things that you already have in your head. An example that I bring up, which is not related to studying is how I&rsquo;m quite good at remembering people&rsquo;s names and the way that I do this is whenever I meet someone and I take their name.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>Desiderable difficulty</strong>, that is the idea that you should be doing revision practices which challenge you. And if they&rsquo;re not feeling them hard enough, then you can put in more active recall, or you can go to more application methods like testing. And so this sad new monarch is basically a set of questions you can ask yourself when you come to revise just to make sure you&rsquo;re doing something which is actually effective.</p>

<h2 id="fun">Fun</h2>
<p>So I think so much of what we view as fun is the narrative we&rsquo;re telling ourselves about something, because if you say I hate maths, then every single time you go to a math lesson that&rsquo;s still in your head. You hate math. You&rsquo;re not gonna enjoy this new thing you&rsquo;re being taught. So I think part of it is noticing personally what you&rsquo;re telling yourself about the things you don&rsquo;t like and then reframing it based off of you as a person and what you do like to find something of value in that</p>
<p>Yes. So again, you can do this through journaling. You can talk to friends about it, but every subject has something brilliant about it. You have to convince yourself sometimes, but I find as soon as you can find a reason for it to be fun, then you can convince yourself of it and make it more bearable.</p>
